# API
The SympoQ's API is a RESTful web service. It allows you to perform RESTful operations like creating a ticket, adding updates to a ticket, listing users (named agents and customers), listing various setting's items, etc. Based on the API description, you can build web, mobile, or server applications that can acces your SympoQ data and services.
